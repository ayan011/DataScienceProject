# DataScienceProject
Some data science projects.

Learning Objectives for Time Series project:
1. Implement a data pre-processing pipeline to clean and wrangle time series data in order to
prepare it for time series modelling.
2. Understand and utilize data visualization and exploratory data analysis techniques to
understand how the time series of COVID-19 Vaccination rates behaves and evolves.
3. Train and test time series data science or machine learning algorithms in order to model
COVID-19 vaccination rates projections under multiple scenarios and gain insights or answer
the overarching question you have chosen to pursue for this project.
4. Improve on skills and competencies required to collate and present domain specific,
evidence-based insights. Particularly, in this case to gain insights and guide the fight
against the COVID-19 pandemic via vaccination.
